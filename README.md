# SoundWave [⚒️ Work in Progress]

## Real-Time Audio Processing and Speech-to-Text with Kafka and Flink

### Overview
SoundWave is a real-time audio processing pipeline that ingests audio streams from multiple sources, performs audio processing tasks (including noise reduction, speech-to-text conversion, and signal mixing), and stores the processed, compressed audio along with a text transcript. Built using Apache Kafka and Apache Flink, SoundWave is optimized for fault tolerance, data redundancy, and efficient storage, using a distributed setup across three laptops.

### Project Features
- Real-Time Audio Ingestion: Captures audio streams from multiple sources.
- Stream Processing: Leverages Kafka for message brokering and Flink for real-time data transformations.
- Speech-to-Text: Converts audio streams to text transcripts.
- Noise Reduction: Enhances audio quality by filtering background noise.
- Signal Mixing: Merges audio from multiple producers into a unified stream.
- Data Redundancy: Ensures reliable data storage with backup and fault tolerance.
